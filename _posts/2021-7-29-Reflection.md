## What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do.
I don’t think that anything that I wrote earlier is wrong, but based on the last few assignments of this course, I’d probably add onto the Data Scientist skillset.
There is a lot of different information sharing and visualization methods that I hadn’t been aware of prior.

## What are your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I do think I’ll use R in the future. Starting this program, I couldn’t produce a “Hello World” output and now I’m able to do so much more. I don’t want to lose this skill and 
I plan to work on adding more languages to my skillset.

## What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
I like using the tidyverse, which is something that I had avoided prior to this course, and plan to use it going forward. I will also be utilizing GitHub more with different 
projects I plan to work on.
