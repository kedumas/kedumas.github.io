I'm a masters student in the [NCSU Online Statistics](https://online-distance.ncsu.edu/program/master-of-statistics/) program. 

## Hobbies

I love to cook. One of the things I like to do is after I try a new and tasty food while on vacation I have to try and recreate it at home. I've learned how to make souffles this way!

In my free time I like to play video games and tabletop RPGs.

I have a cat named Nyx. She's just over a year and a half and is a huge handful.
